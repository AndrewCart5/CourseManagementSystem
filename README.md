This is an advanced application where teaches, administrators, and  students can manager their classes, grades, and attendance. Students, administrators, and  teachers are able to login to an existing account or create a new account. Based off of the responsibilities and what is allowed to be done by each type of account, the user can do various things.
A few of the things a student can do include being able to sign up for classes and being able to check their grade and attendance for a class.
A few of the things a teacher can do include assigning grades to individual students, keeping track of attendance, being able to view the grades that students have received, and being able to register/drop classes to teach.
